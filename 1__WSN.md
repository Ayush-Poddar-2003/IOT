# WSN
Wireless Sensor Network  
Collection of spatially distributed autonomous sensors   
that monitor physical or environmental conditions (like temperature, sound, pressure, etc.) and  
communicate wirelessly to send the collected data to a central system.

### Key Components of WSN
1. Sensor Nodes (Motes)  
Detect environmental changes.  
Contain a sensor, microcontroller, transceiver, and battery.

2. Sink (Base Station/Gateway)  
Collects data from sensor nodes and sends to a server or cloud.

3. Communication Network  
Typically wireless (ZigBee, LoRa, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.)

4. Power Source  
Mostly battery-powered; energy efficiency is critical.

### WSN Technologies
| Protocol      | Range      | Use                        |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| **ZigBee**    | \~10–100 m | Low power, short range     |
| **LoRa**      | \~2–10 km  | Long range, low data rate  |
| **Bluetooth** | \~10 m     | Short range, personal area |
| **Wi-Fi**     | \~100 m    | High data, high power use  |
