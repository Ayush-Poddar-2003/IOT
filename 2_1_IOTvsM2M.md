# IOT VS M2M

## M2M
Direct communication between devices (machines) using wired or wireless communication without human intervention

Characteristics:  
1. Point-to-point communication: Typically, M2M connects devices in a network thatexchanges data directly.
2. Proprietary networks: Often uses cellular, satellite, or private networks.
3. Automation: Devices exchange information to perform tasks automatically.
4. Limited scope: Usually focuses on specific industrial or enterprise applications.
5. Less internet-centric: Can work over private or closed networks, not necessarily using internet protocols.
