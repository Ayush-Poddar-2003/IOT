| **Aspect**           | **Physical Servers**                                                     | **Cloud-Based Servers**                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Location**         | On-premise (your own hardware/data center)                               | Hosted remotely by cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)                               |
| **Cost**             | High upfront cost (hardware, maintenance)                                | Pay-as-you-go model, cost-effective initially                                            |
| **Scalability**      | Limited — needs hardware upgrades                                        | Easily scalable — increase resources with demand                                         |
| **Maintenance**      | Requires manual updates, physical access                                 | Handled by cloud provider (automatic updates)                                            |
| **Deployment Speed** | Slower — setup and configuration required                                | Very fast — deploy in minutes                                                            |
| **Accessibility**    | Limited to specific network unless exposed                               | Accessible from anywhere over the internet                                               |
| **Security**         | You control security completely                                          | Shared responsibility model (cloud provider handles infra security, you manage app/data) |
| **Data Control**     | Full control over data location and privacy                              | Some dependence on cloud provider policies and region                                    |
| **Downtime Risk**    | Depends on your infrastructure quality                                   | Cloud providers offer high availability & redundancy                                     |
| **Use in IoT**       | Local control, real-time processing (e.g., factory automation, edge IoT) | Large-scale analytics, global connectivity, device management                            |
